## 2.2.1
Hi, it's been a while!

Originally, YtcFilter's developer (RomainLK) discontinued development of the extension in 2021. Due to Google's forced introduction of Manifest v3, YtcFilter was due for removal from the Chrome Web Store in June 2024. However, the LiveTL team (the devs behind LiveTL, HyperChat, and several official Hololive projects) has revived development for the project.

YtcFilter v3 is all-new: the entire codebase has been rewritten from scratch, and new powerful filtering functionality has been added. We are currently wrapping up our beta testing phase, and we will roll out the update sometime within the next two months.

Because the v2 extension is very outdated, we cannot guarantee that all data will be transferred correctly to v3. Therefore, we urge you to **BACK UP YOUR YTCFILTER STORAGE DATA** as soon as possible. This can be done through YtcFilter Popout -> Settings -> Help -> Copy Storage.

If you prefer to continue using YtcFilter v2 rather than upgrading, your options are limited (due to Google's forced MV3 rollout). You may need to find a browser which will continue providing MV2 functionality and sideload a custom release from the [v2 repository](https://github.com/RomainLK/ytc-filter/releases/tag/v2.2.0).

If you have any questions or would like to participate in the YtcFilter v3 beta test, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/uJrV3tmthg); we would be happy to assist you. The source code for YtcFilter v3 is also open source [on GitHub](https://github.com/LiveTL/ytcfilter).

Please look forward to the v3 update!

## 2.2.0
Bug fixes:
- Word-break change

## 2.1.6

Bug fixes:
- Prevent clear archive button of breaking every video settings
- Fix the remaning storage space indicator again, change was rollbacked in 2.1.5 accidentally
## 2.1.5

Improvements:
- Added a button to copy storage so as to simplify bug reports.

Bug fixes:
- Double check version number to be sure that store is loaded. This a theorical bug fix for dissapearing configurations. The problem is random/can't be reproduced so this fix may or may not work.
- Avoid error message in console when a message has no content or no author
- Prevent submit on preset creation, resulting in popout reload
- Fix embedded ytcFilter's height not being restored properly
## 2.1.4

Improvements:
- Block/report button is now in the message toolbar to prevent the slight resizing of message
- Started to write help documentation. Still in progress
- Some styling work. Still in progress.
- Alphanumeric preset now ensure that there is at least 1 character
- Polling to load ytcFilter. Avoid the "ytcFilter is loading" message. No known origin; it could be an update from Youtube
- Popout's title now has the title of the video
- Reduce asynchronous code
- Less alarming logs
- Tooltip for statistic explains the 2 capture modes

Bug fixes:
- Properly manage messages without author
- Word break for message without spaces

- Prevent breaking the popout when a video's settings are corrupted
- Thanks Kento Nishi for suggesting to remove 0 width characters from messages
- Fix the remaning storage space indicator


## 2.1.3

Changes:
- Build no longer compress files in order to hopefully, accelerate review process

Bug fixes:
- Remove block/report button cleanly so that Youtube's livechat can recycle them
- Optimize migration to 2.1.x. It should prevent high CPU/RAM usage during migration, if you haven't migrated already.
- Fix filtering by role in other language than English
- Avoid disconnecting chat when other extensions which require to patch Fetch like LiveTL are enabled

## 2.1.2

Bug fixes:
- Fix session stats for filtered message which would count 1 message several per filter it matched
- Fix filtering when a user may be both a moderator and member
- Fix missing color for super chat

## 2.1.1

Bug fixes:
- (Firefox only) Fixed a bug preventing messages to be persisted/displayed in popout when switching to the fetch interceptor

## 2.1.0 Kanata

Good bye old interface.

New features:
- Integrate Youtube's block/report menu in current session of embedded ytcFilter so as to fight against spam even for those without the extension. Note that due to the new fetch interceptor, the menu integration may take a minute to appear as fetch interceptor is faster than the livechat. Also, due to Youtube's limitation and performance, the menu can't be used if the message is no longer in the chat, so it's not permanent and may also be missing.
- Drag resize of embedded ytcFIlter
- Configurable automatic storage management
- Alert every minute if less than 5% of storage is available (Firefox is not supported)


Improvements:
- Removed legacy code for old interface which should result in better performance than 2.0.x
- Added a fetch interceptor to complement the Mutation observer. At first, Mutation observer will filter the first few message, but when the chat start to refresh from server, the task is delegated to the fetch interceptor. This has several effects: better performance without hitting the Youtube server, no more message/badge mixing, and for VOD, it will predict future messages.
- Profiles are renamed to preset to better convey how they should be used
- Reworked the interface. All presets related configuration are moved to their own tab
- Back to the 1 line compact interface for embedded ytcFilter
- Reduce storage usage per message.

Bug fixes:
- Fix regex for English tagged messages. Big thanks to NaGel.
- Fix slight size difference when opening popout with or without settings
- Fix possible case where ytcFilter may no longer load if you close a video before it had time loading
- Fix auto max height being too tall
- Potential fix for channel reordering when deleting a video archive

## 2.0.4

Bug fixes:
- Remove uneeded test files in release

## 2.0.3

Bug fixes:
- Due to how unpredictable storage usage has been for users, instead of migrating old messages, they are simply deleted.
- Prevent immediate reload when resizing popout
- Firefox only: Fix vuex-webextension library which failed to save the store in storage
- Single bootstraping at any time to avoid potential corruption of the store

## 2.0.2

I have reports of the extension needing history permission in 2.0.0 for Chrome. I don't know what happened but I have not requested history permission nor do I read it. Only tabs permission was added, and even this will be removed in this version.

Firefox version has rollbacked to 1.8.0 due to it being unable to keep its configuration after a restart of the browser. A fix will come at later date.

Bug fixes:
- Remove uneeded tabs permission

## 2.0.1
